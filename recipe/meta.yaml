  summary: PyMC - Bayesian Stochastic Modelling in Python
  description: |
    PyMC is a python module that implements Bayesian statistical models and fitting algorithms, including Markov chain
    Monte Carlo. Its flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of problems. Along with core
    sampling functionality, PyMC includes methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence
    diagnostics.
